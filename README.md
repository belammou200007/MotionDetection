# Welcome to GitHub Desktop!
This simple project uses some basic opencv algorathims to detect movement.
Basically it takes two frames at a time and gets the abs diff then after applying some gaussian blur, it scans the threshold_diff for any non zero pixels using the count_non_zero function, it that's the case a function which you can add based on your choice will be activated.
                        THAT'S ALL AND THANK YOU FOR CHECKING MY LITTLE PROJECT OUT.
